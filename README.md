Candidate Numbers: 44158 and 50537

**Project Description:**





**Modelling:**

The analysis was done in the following order and using the following programs:

1) Contingency Tables (1/3) - Python Notebook for intial data manipulation of survey data. This is where we converted the data from the initial format into a series of three contingency tables for each question.

2) Assumption Checking (2/3) - R code for checking assumptions of Poisson GLMs on the data.

3) Models (3/3) - Python Notebook for fitting the main models and extracting interactions.



**Data:**

1) Original Data contains the data we collected at the start in its original form.
2) Group Data contains the three final datasets we used for our analysis and model fitting.






**Results:**
